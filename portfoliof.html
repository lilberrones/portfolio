        Before this class, I never knew about WebStorm.
        At all. After using it all semester, I realized how great of a developer tool it is.
        It allows users to create projects, connect to your GitHub, push/pull your data to/from repositories on GitHub,
        make deployment servers, start an SHH session, and that's just the beginning of it. WebStorm is a versatile tool
        and is something I'll like to keep practicing on.

        GitHub is like what the name implies, your central hub for your git repositories and/or projects. You create an account and you can begin creating repositories here. A repository is basically your main project that will store the file you push up to it,
        and download the most recent file by pulling it down via WebStorm. To see what repositories I have made,

        I knew the basics of HTML and CSS before I entered this class; thanks to Codecademy.
        I was familiar with certain elements but I have definitely learned more about HTML and CSS.
        Along with this, I learned about linux commands. These commands lessen the use of clicking around
        so memorizing certain commands will speed up some processes.

            Though, I just learned about Bootstrap, I was immediately intrigued by it.
            Most sites now utilize Bootstrap and it's no longer basic html and css.
            I can imagine that Bootstrap allows website-making to be less stressful with
            its templates for buttons, layouts, and other various gadget and allows websites to look more modern.
